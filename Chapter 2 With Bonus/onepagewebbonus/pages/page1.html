          Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins,
          Indiana, in the 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory
          ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States
          Department of Energy but also secretly experiments with the paranormal
          and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. They have
          inadvertently created a portal to an alternate dimension they refer to
          as the Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of
          Hawkins in unusual ways.
