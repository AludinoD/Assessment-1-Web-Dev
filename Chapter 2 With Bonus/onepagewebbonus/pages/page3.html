          <h3>One of the best supernatural shows ever</h3>
          <p>
            Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a
            show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard
            to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those
            expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show
            that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was
            not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love
            this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming
            season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast
            grow up, they were children when this show first started and now
            they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and
            going to miss it when it's gone!
          </p>
          <h3>Never judge a book by its cover.</h3>
          <p>
            I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this
            was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed
            at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far
            from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind
            of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in
            the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the
            production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is
            incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting,
            takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season
            one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the
            first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment.

          <h3>Captures that '80s magic</h3>
          <p>
            There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take
            place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the
            chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the
            inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural
            movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that
            sort of thing. The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's
            not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the
            scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their
            inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure
            teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad
            science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful
            mom. You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche
            made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really
            feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as
            though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got
            to working. While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg
            films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The
            story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and
            the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy.
